Warm greetings to all! <br />

On behalf of office of Career Development & Placement Cell services at IIITM Gwalior and my personal behalf, I welcome you to our webpage. It's a matter of great pride to mention that we IIITians at Gwalior, celebrating the 25th year of establishment. We are the one of the most preferred institutes in the area of IT and CS to a number of industries hiring the quality candidates skilled with IT as well as Management skills. So far our experience has been fantastic in getting very good feedback from our recruiters in India or overseas, especially on the capability, skill set, intellect and the professional readiness displayed by our students. We always believe in the philosophy of a long term partnership with our recruiters and alumni of IIITM Gwalior and remain committed in making their experience as scintillating as possible. Its my proud privilege inviting the organizations and students to work on finding the best match between the recruiters need and the satisfaction of the students. Wish you all the best! <br />

Thanks,
